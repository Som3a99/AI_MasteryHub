    "- **Late 1980s**: Guido van Rossum began working on Python at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the ABC language that could handle exceptions and interface with the Amoeba operating system.\n",
    "- **1989**: During Christmas, van Rossum started implementing Python as a hobby project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 1.0 (1991)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **February 20, 1991**: The first version of Python (0.9.0) was released. It included functions, exception handling, and the core data types: str, list, dict, etc.\n",
    "- **January 26, 1994**: Python 1.0 was officially released. It introduced important features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2.0 (2000)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **October 16, 2000**: Python 2.0 was released, bringing new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.\n",
    "- The 2.x series continued to evolve, with Python 2.7 being the last release of the series in 2010. Python 2.7 included features like enhanced library support, improved integer division, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 3.0 (2008)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **December 3, 2008**: Python 3.0, also known as \"Python 3000\" and \"Py3k,\" was released. This version was not backward-compatible with Python 2.x. It aimed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language.\n",
    "- Python 3 introduced many new features and improvements, including print as a function, the `bytes` type, keyword-only arguments, and a more consistent Unicode handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2 End of Life**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **January 1, 2020**: Python 2 reached its end of life, with no further updates or support. The Python community encouraged all users to transition to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Today**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python continues to grow in popularity due to its readability, extensive standard library, and vibrant community. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and many other fields. The language's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it accessible to beginners and powerful for experienced developers.\n"
